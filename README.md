# FormatterX - The intelligent chat formatting plugin

## Description
The plugin enables advanced text formatting in Minecraft, supporting various formatting styles such as:
- **Ampersand Format** (`&a`, `&l` and other codes)
- **Minecraft Legacy** (`§c`, `§l` and other codes)
- **MinecraftRGB** (`&#FF00FF` for custom colors)
- **LuckPerms RGB** (`§x§F§F§0§0§F§F`)
- **MiniMessage** (full support for formatting methods - check https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html)

**The plugin doesn't require any additional plugins to format your chat. However, the full potential of FormatterX is revealed when integrated with other plugins.**

## Integrations
The plugin works with the following plugins, though none are required for its functionality:
- **LuckPerms** – retrieving group information
- **PlaceholderAPI** and **MiniPlaceholder** – handling dynamic values
- **Vault and VaultUnlocked** – retrieving prefixes, suffixes, and group names
- Support for all plugins utilizing Vault

## Key Features
- **Support for multiple formats simultaneously** – mix different formatting styles without affecting the plugin's operation.
- **Individual formatting for each rank/group** – or a single format for all players.
- **Advanced permission system** – filter messages to prevent unauthorized players from using certain formats (e.g., `formatterx.legacy.color`).
- **Automatic removal of unauthorized formatting** – if a player lacks the required permissions, their message will be displayed without the prohibited formatting.
- **Configurable feedback messages** – set notifications for players when they lack the necessary permissions.
- **Custom placeholder templates** – simplify formatting usage through predefined variables.
